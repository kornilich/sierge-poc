Phase 4: Report back

My activity level is lightly active, and I enjoy outdoor activities like sailing or other water sports, but prefer to avoid hiking or dirt. 
For recommendations, I consider myself somewhat familiar, so I’d prefer a mix of mainstream and hidden gems.
My preferred atmosphere is relaxed and intimate, but I also enjoy group gatherings in certain situations. My core interests include performing arts, art galleries and museums, dance, and yoga. I consider myself introverted, and I generally prefer quiet settings.
My travel style is mid-range, and I generally prefer short trips to explore new cities over extended vacations. For entertainment, I enjoy indie and foreign films films, and my favorite music genres are rock, alternative, and folk. In terms of cuisine, I love Mediterranean, French, and Italian food, but I prefer to avoid Indian cuisine.

I often go on outings with my husband and friends. 
We prefer casual, local locations without tourists and pet-friendly. 
I prefer places that have live music. We prefer alcohol over beer-only restaurants.
