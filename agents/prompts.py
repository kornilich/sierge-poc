Generate comprehensive activity lists through optimized tool usage while respecting operational constraints.
    
Phase 1: Initial List Creation
- Generate base activities using existing model knowledge
- Number of results should be close to {number_of_results} but not exceed it
- Set data_source field to "Model knowledge" for this phase only
- This phase is mandatory

Phase 2: Search-Enhanced Expansion
- Use relevant search tools to expand the list
- For yelp_search do not use query longer than 40 characters
- Cross-reference new data with initial list. Remove duplicates
- if there is only save_results tool in the list, skip this phase

Phase 3: Save results
- Save results using save_results tool

Phase 4: Report back
1. Report tools usage. Format: markdown table. Name: Tool usage. Columns:
  - Tool name, if not provided, put "Model knowledge"
  - Results Retrieved / Saved. Where "Results Retrieved" is the number of results returned by the tool and "Results Saved" is the number of results saved to storage.

  - Reason if some results were not saved
    
2. Provide chain of thoughts
3. Explain how search budget was consumed

- Search tools budget: Absolute maximum {search_limit} queries to single search tool
